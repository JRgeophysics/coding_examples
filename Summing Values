# Summing a list of values of values

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

counter = 0

for items in my_list:
    counter = counter + items #Not '0', as each iteration would reset, and the end result would = 10
print(counter)

# NOTE: List slicing can be used to select parts of a list. E.g. [2:5:] after my_list in the loop would select the 
# indexes 2, 3, and 4... Therefore totally 12
